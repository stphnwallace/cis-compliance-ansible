# This code needs to be found in a subdirectory called "lockdown"
--------
# The three goals for this module.
## AUDIT a RHEL or Centos o/s and report on CIS compliance
## LOCKDOWN selected CIS *level 1* items. It can address level 2 fixes, however this is disabled by default
## TEST for cis-level1 compliance ongoing, and alert on config drift as desired. Can be plugged into monitoring, or run on demand.

# Compatibility: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.X (tested 7.1 - 7.7) and CentOS 7.4 (tested 7.4 - 7.7, note CentOS version below 7.4 may have issues with SSH).
# Note latest centos7 is v7.8. There's a manual update below to make this work.

# LAUNCH a container for CIS testing / lockdown, attaching ./lockdown in the currnt directory as a mountable volume inside the container
docker run --detach --privileged --volume=/sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro --volume=`pwd`/lockdown:/mnt:ro centos7-ansible:latest
